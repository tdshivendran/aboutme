        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Since my early age, I've been curious about how things worked.
            This led me to the joy of dismantle things and analyze to see how they functioned.
            Although I don’t dismantle things needlessly nowadays, I find myself enjoying learning and understanding new things.

            " <em>The joy of learning and challenging myself to be a better me</em> " has been my motto since my childhood.

        <h2>Education and Experience</h2>
        <p>
            My undergrad in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering has explored me to understand things in a more comprehensive manner.
            Automation being a major part, I started to learn and build software tools to automate stuff.
            Here is where I built my first bot that performed few simple tasks.
            Also, I worked on project that uses prediction techniques to find faults in highly critical process.

            To me software development is not only simulating a real-world process but also provide tools to automate stuff and make it easier for people to accomplish their tasks.
            As an Developer, I enjoyed working on building tools that automated complex manual tasks that took weeks to perform, to be done in hours thus saving time and effort.

            During my Master’s in computers and Information Systems Security, I learnt to write secure and efficient code and explore concepts in networking and security.
            I have worked on setting up secure routers and developing secure applications.
