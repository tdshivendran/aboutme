        <p>
            A passionate software developer, specializing in building JavaScript-based front-end applications, as well as developing python based back-end web applications.
            I enjoy building custom tools and applications because I learn and improve my skills on the go.

            " <em>The joy of learning and the challenge to be a better version of myself</em> " has been my drive since my childhood.

        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>
            Since my early age, I appreciated the joy of discovery.
            Curiosity drove me into finding answers about how things worked.
            It helped me to dismantle things apart to see how they worked.
            I also began fixing stuff and building small things with what I can find.
        </p>

            Although I donâ€™t find myself tinkering unnecessarily nowadays, I relish the process of creating, maintaining and enhancing, not just for the benefit of myself but also for the best of others.
            Software development gives me the opportunity to provide people with easy to use tools and effortlessly accomplish their tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy programming because the journey towards a finished product entices me the most.
            The challenges along the journey give me the opportunities to learn and enrich myself while creating something of value.
